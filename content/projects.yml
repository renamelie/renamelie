    I've been spending a lot of time playing around with Gatsby lately but one thing I hadn't tackled was making an e-commerce solution. I did a little reading around and came across Snipcart. It looked perfect for my needs and has a brilliant test environment so I decided to give it a go.

    I made a speedy e-commerce site using Gatsby with DatoCMS and Snipcart.

    TRAVEL WISH LIST!

    There are SO many places in the world I want to see, and so many things I want to experience. I thought it would be a great idea to compile a list, so I can tick them off when completed ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s ambitious, but Iâ€™ll get there eventuallyâ€¦.
