    From 2018–⁠2019 I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace, a Web3 data marketplace to explore, download, and publish open data sets registered in the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    As the main frontfacing UI of Ocean Protocol, it serves as a product and showcase bringing together the complete Ocean Protocol stack in a simple interface. Additionally, the project was created with developers in mind, making Commons the most complete boilerplate for creating dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Now.

    Besides designing and implementing new features, I maintained the front-end of the ChartMogul application and implemented the UI design system by refactoring most of its front-end codebase.

This included conceptualizing executing, and iterating on the creative & visual direction of the ezeep brand.

    I was leading the UI design & development of all ezeep touch points and - as a product designer - defined the ezeep product based on user and market research in an iterative process. On top of that, I designed and helped building all app experiences of ezeep on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

    In 2008 I used the camera obscura as it was used by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 to create an Aperture and iPhoto replacement icon.

    Nicéphore Niépce made it first possible to preserve an image taken with a camera obscura in 1826 or 1827 by using a special mixture of bitumen on a glass or metal plate, naming it Heliography. This first preserved image 'View from the Window at Le Gras' is the one you can see in the iPhoto icon.
